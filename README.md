# Master Password Cross Browser Extension
A cross browser extension based on the [Javascript implmentation](https://github.com/tmthrgd/mpw-js) (by Tom Thorogood) of the [Master Password](https://gitlab.com/MasterPassword) algorithm by Maarten Billemont

This extension is written for Firefox and makes use of the [Web Extension Polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) in order to be compatible with Chromium based browsers.
